Main problem: how to export data from KDBX and import it to the KeyChain (cloud) on MacOS?
I have been moved from Windows to MacOS recently and I had to change password manager - from KeePass to MacPass (both supports KDBX files).
I recommend doing periodical manual synchronization between KDBX and KeyChain be have always updated passwords.
I also strongly recommend reading warnings included in the bash script.

Short manual:
1. In Safari go to and delete current passwords: Preferences > Passwords > Cmd+A > Remove
2. Export passwords from MacPass to XML (save it to local disk) and convert it into CSV file (sh xml2csv.sh FILENAME)
3. In Firefox go to and import CSV file: Preferences > Privacy & Security > Import/Export Passwords > Import Passwords (check also import faults)
4. In Safari go to and import passwords from Firefox: File > Import From > Firefox > Passwords > Import
5. Delete all passwords from Firefox and XML/CSV files from local disk (wait about 5 minutes to be sure that Safari imported everything!)

Why Firefox?
You have to have Firefox 56 because this is the latest version that have possibility to import passwords.
But why Firefox?
Because there is no possibility to import XML/CSV files into Safari. You can just import passwords from another browser like Firefox.

Download Firefox version 56:
https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/56.0.2/mac/en-US/Firefox%2056.0.2.dmg
TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES IMMEDIATELY !!!
Install plugin Password Exporter:
